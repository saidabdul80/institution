## GPA Calculation Logic

### Semester GPA Calculation
```
GPA = Total Credit Points / Total Credit Units
where Credit Points = Grade Point × Credit Unit for each course
```

### Cumulative GPA Calculation
```
CGPA = Total Cumulative Points / Total Registered Credit Units
where Total Cumulative Points = Sum of all credit points across all semesters
```

### Academic Status Determination
- **Good Standing**: CGPA ≥ 1.50
- **Probation**: 1.00 ≤ CGPA < 1.50
- **Withdrawal**: CGPA < 1.00 (usually after 2 consecutive semesters)

### Grade Point Scale (Nigerian Standard)
- **A**: 70-100 (5.0 points)
- **B**: 60-69 (4.0 points)
- **C**: 50-59 (3.0 points)
- **D**: 45-49 (2.0 points)
- **E**: 40-44 (1.0 points)
- **F**: 0-39 (0.0 points)

## Result Compilation Process

### 1. Data Collection
- Retrieve all student course registrations for specified parameters
- Group registrations by student
- Collect existing results for each course

### 2. Grade Calculation
- Apply grading scale to raw scores
- Calculate grade points and quality points
- Identify failed courses (carry-overs)

### 3. GPA Computation
- Calculate semester GPA based on current semester performance
- Retrieve previous semester data for CGPA calculation
- Update cumulative totals (credit units, credit points)

### 4. Academic Status Update
- Determine academic status based on CGPA
- Track number of semesters completed
- Update carry-over course list

### 5. Data Persistence
- Create or update semester GPA records
- Update result records with calculated grades
- Log compilation process details

## Usage Examples

### Compiling Results
```javascript
// Compile results for 200 Level Computer Science students
const compilationData = {
    session_id: 1,
    semester: 1,
    level_id: 2,
    programme_id: 5,
    department_id: 3
};

const result = await post('/api/staff/results/compile-advanced', compilationData);
```

### Retrieving GPA Records
```javascript
// Get GPA records for current session
const gpaRecords = await get('/api/staff/results/semester-gpa?session_id=1&semester=1');
```

### Creating Course Allocation
```javascript
// Allocate lecturer to a course
const allocation = {
    staff_id: 10,
    course_id: 25,
    session_id: 1,
    semester: 1,
    programme_id: 5,
    level_id: 2,
    allocation_type: 'lecturer'
};

await post('/api/staff/staff-course-allocations', allocation);
```
