### **Route Coverage**
All permissions found in the Staff module routes are now included in the configuration file.

### **Consistency**
- Permission naming follows consistent patterns
- Descriptions are clear and descriptive
- Categories are logically organized

### **Role Assignments**
- Each role has been updated with relevant permissions
- Permissions are assigned based on typical job responsibilities
- Hierarchical access is maintained (Admin > Registrar > Academic Officer, etc.)

### **Future Maintenance**
- New permissions should be added to appropriate categories
- Role assignments should be reviewed when adding new permissions
- Consider creating specialized roles for specific departments if needed

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Database Update**: Run the permission seeder to update the database with new permissions
2. **Role Review**: Review role assignments with stakeholders to ensure they match organizational needs
3. **Testing**: Test all routes to ensure permissions are working correctly
4. **Documentation**: Update user manuals with new permission descriptions
5. **Training**: Train administrators on the new permission structure

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- All existing permissions have been preserved
- New permissions are additive - no functionality is removed
- Role assignments may need adjustment based on institutional policies
- Some permissions may need to be granted to existing users manually
- Consider creating custom roles for specific use cases if the default roles don't fit

This update ensures that the permission system accurately reflects all the functionality available in the Staff module and provides granular control over user access.
